# Scrapy_101
**A simple guide to running your first sscrapy scraper.** </br>
Scrapy is a fast open source and collaborative web crawling framework written in Python, used to extract the data from web page with the help of selectors based on XPath. </br>

### Prerequisites 
You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies and Python. A basic understanding of XPath is a plus. </br>

### Website used to scrape
I chose http://quotes.toscrape.com/ to scrape. It is a website that displays various quotes based on different tags and also include the author's name. </br>

### Installing Scrapy and creating a new project
To install scrapy run the following command on your terminal or command prompt: </br>
```
Pip install scrapy
```
This will install scrapy. </br>
**Note:**  If you're on windows, make sure to install  **PyWin32**. </br>
